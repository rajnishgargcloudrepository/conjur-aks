## Lab Guide Version
- Version 1.0
- Release Date 10 October 2021

## Prerequisite
- You have basic understanding Linux installation and administration
- You have basic understanding Docker
- You have basic understanding MySQL Administration
- You have basic understanding Azure configuration and administration
  - For setup the lab, you better knew how to config Azure VM, VNet, AKS, Security Group and Azure ACR
- You have basic understanding Azure AKS Kubernetes setup and administration

## Lab Architecture
- AKS is used as platform to host the [demo app](https://github.com/jeepapichet/cityapp). The application will connect to a MySQL database to retreive data, and during authenication, [secrets](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/Get%20Started/key_concepts/secrets.html) will be used by the application
- The lab was based on Conjur Version 12.2.0

## Lab Guide

### [Task 0: Setup Utilities Host](00-Setup_Utilities_Host.md)
An Azure VM is required as an utilities host serving the following functions:
- Jump host to access the AKS environment
- Docker host for Conjur Master container
- Docker host for MySQL database container
We will also configure the Private DNS zone for name resolution here

### [Task 1: Create AKS Cluster](01-Create_AKS_Cluster.md)
We will provision an AKS cluster that will run the following workloads:
- Conjur Followers
- Demo Application Containers (cityapp)
We will also provision an ACR and integrate with the AKS cluster

### [Task 2: Setup MySQL Database](02-Setup-MySQL-Database.md)
Our sample application uses a MySQL database.
In later sections, we will demostrate the hardcoded versus secretless connection methods used by the sample application to connect to this MySQL database,

### [Task 3: Deploy App with Embedded Secret](03-Deploy_App_with_Embedded_Secret.md)
Get familiar with AKS by deploying a sample application to the AKS cluster.
The CityApp application connects to the MySQL database setup in task 03 and displays a random city name in the web application.
The MySQL database credentials specified in task 03 will be embedded in the kubernetes deployment configuration file.

### [Task 4: Deploy App with Embedded Secret](04-Deploy_App_with_Embedded_Secret.md)

### [Task 5: Setup Conjur Master Server](05-Setup_Conjur_Master.md)

### [Task 6: Deploy Follower with Seed Fetcher](06-Deploy_Follower_with_Seed_Fetcher.md)

### [Task 7: Deploy App to EKS Cluster with CyberArk Summon Secrets Injection](07-Deploy_App_with_Summon_Secrets_Injects.md)

### [Task 8: Deploy App to EKS Cluster with CyberArk Secretless Broker](08-Deploy_App_with_Cyberark_Secretless_Broker.md)

### [Congratulation!!! Lab Completed](Task09/readme.md)
